# Wireless Display using Bluetooth
The project “Wireless Display Using Bluetooth” is an innovative approach of intimating messages to the people. An electronic display is used that is synchronized using Bluetooth technology to wirelessly display the given messages. 

Wireless electronic display can replace the traditional display boards which are inconvenient to update on a regular basis. We are very familiar with the notice boards present in schools and colleges where information is written or printed on paper and pinned onto the noticeboards. This is time consuming and at the same time leads to wastage of paper. Such notice boards can be replaced with wireless display boards so that the information can be updated using a smartphone wirelessly using Bluetooth technology and also a lot of paper can be saved.

We present in this presentation the development of a smartphone controlled wireless electronic display which can be updated automatically and remotely. The given system is implemented using an Arduino UNO microcontroller, Bluetooth Module and an LCD Display.
